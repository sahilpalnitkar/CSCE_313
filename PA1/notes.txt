Bisect memory when required. Keep more memory together as much as possible. If you require smaller memory, bisect only one part. If you start with 1024B and need only 128B, break the original into 2 pieces of 512B, then one of those into 2 pieces of 256B and then one of those into two pieces of 128B and then use one of those pieces as memory. 

Don't try to merge two equal blocks of memory if they are from different parents, as it will mess up the pointers. If you give the adress to a memory block of 256B, it should be 2 blocks of 128B next to each other. and not at different places in the total memory. Blocks of memory which are buddies with the same values should be merged whenever possible. If they are not buddies, DO NOT MERGE

To keep track of how many blocks are available, move the head pointer and make new head pointers named differently and store them in an array. The array can look like 512B to the first block of a linked list with blocks of with 512B blocks, and 256B points to the first block of a linked list with blocks of 256B memory and so on. Now if you have to use 128B of memory, go to the index of 128B in the array and go to the pointer in that position. You are now in the linked list of 128B blocks. Take the first
