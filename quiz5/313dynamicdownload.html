<a name="late"><h1>Late Assignments</h1></a>
<p> Each programming assignment will have a specified date and time at which it is due. 
The late penalty is 0.5% of your score every hour, which equals 12% per day.</p>

<a name="attendance"><h1>Attendance</h1></a>
	
</p> Attendance is expected in the course and will be recorded in both lectures and labs on some random days, if not everyday. Students with absences must notify the instructor ahead of time about any planned missed classes or labs. Unless an absence during a class-quiz is approved beforehand, there won't be any make up opportunity. Historically, there has been strong correlation between absence and low grades in this course.</p>	

<a name="communication"><h1>Communication Policy</h1></a>
<p>Instructor, Teaching Assistants, and Peer Teachers for this course will do their best to communicate relevant administrative information (deadlines, information about posted material, details about projects, locations of tutorials, and so on) in an effective and timely manner. 

We will be using piazza for announcements, class- materials and discussion. E-mails in howdy course roster will be used to enrol students in Piazza (you should receive an invitation email). If you are not enrolled by mistake or because you joined the class later, please contact the instructor. Outside piazza, you are welcome to show up during office hours of the instruction staff.

While using piazza, please try to ensure that the question you are going to ask is not already asked by another student or posted by instructors as clarifications. This is important because we want to use our time wisely and thereby assist you effectively. In addition, we will try to post Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) regarding each programming assignment from previous semester's piazza discussions. 
</p>
 
<a name="acahonesty"><h1>Academic Honesty</h1></a>
<p>The Aggie Honor Code is: "An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do." Upon
accepting admission to Texas A & M University, a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold
the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor
System. Students will be required to state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other
academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the TAMU community from the
requirements or the processes of the Honor System. For additional information please visit: <a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/</a></p>
<p>For this class, certain aspects of the honor code need to be clarified.
	<ol>
	<li>There will be times in this course where you make use of external code/software/libraries. Whenever this is done, you must make sure that you:
		<ul>
			<li>Follow any licensing and/or use restrictions that library/code requires</li>
			<li>Clearly document what the source of the external code was, and how it was used</li>
		</ul>
	
	<li>Coding together with another student is not OK. Any assistance received from other students needs to be clearly documented.</li>
	<li>We have solutions to all previous offerings from this course. We will run plagiarism check against those previous submissions in addition to those from this semster.</li>
	
	
		</ul>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>If there are any questions or concerns about whether an action is appropriate, you should check with the
professor or teaching assistant first. If in doubt, assume that it is not appropriate.</p>

<a name="ada"><h1>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h1></a>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845-1637.
