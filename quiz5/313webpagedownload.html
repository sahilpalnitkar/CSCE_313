	<a name="objectives"><h1>Course Objectives</h1></a>
	<p>The objective of this course is to provide you with a general understanding of what system software is
involved for an application program to run, both on a single node and over a network, and how this system
software is to be used. In support of this, the course will prepare you to do system-level programming.
This course will show you how to <i>"use"</i> (as opposed to <i>"design"</i>) system components, such as memory, file
systems, process control, inter-process communication, and networking. By the end of this course you will
have an understanding of the problems and pitfalls typically encountered in the design and implementation
of multi-threaded and networked applications and systems. More specifically, by the end of this course you
should be fairly good at making full use of the services provided by the underlying operating system by
programming directly at the operating system interface level. We will review the following aspects of a
computer system, in no particular order:

<ul>
	<li>What is an operating system; what are its components; why system calls?</li>
	<li>Execution of a program; function calls; interrupts</li>
	<li>The OS application interface; file system; process control; etc</li>
	<li>Concurrency, threads, process/thread synchronization</li>
	<li>Inter-process communication</li>
	<li>Network socket programming</li>
</ul>
		
<a name="prereqs"><h1>Prerequisites</h1></a>
	<p>This class is intended for students who have completed CSCE 312 - Computer Organization, and have familiarity with C/C++ programming.</p>

<a name="class-meetings"><h1>Class Meetings</h1></a>
<p>During lectures, we will cover Operating Systems and Systems Programming concepts and case studies.
The material covered in the lectures will provide the background and foundation for you to appreciate the
lab assignments and to succeed in them. Reading of assigned portions in the textbook and other related
material is your responsibility. You are also expected to follow instructions and be aware of announcements
made during lectures. Attendance is mandatory as it will be recorded.</p>

<a name="quizzes"><h1>Quizzes</h1></a>
<p>Several quizzes will be conducted in class and the rest will be given as take-home tasks. They will be aligned with key topic learning. Most topics take 2-3 lectures to finish so you may expect quizzes at that beat rate. Regular attendance, in-class participation, and diligent off line follow-up on key concepts will be key to doing well on these quizzes. Note that quizzes count a significant portion of your grade, and thus requires more preparation compared to quizzes in other courses.</p>

<a name="labs"><h1>Labs</h1></a>
<p>Labs constitute a very important part of this course, where you will put into practice the material learned in the lectures, and acquire a working knowledge of the UNIX/LINUX operating system. Labs will meet twice every week, where the TA will either present a new programming assignment, or assist with the one that is running. There will be a series of 5-6 programming assignments of moderate difficulty level, which will exercise different parts of the operating system: memory management, file system, process and thread management, inter-process communication, networked execution, and so on. Lab attendance is necessary to ensure you understand the problem and get assistance from the TA and the assigned peer teachers.</p>

<a name="exams"><h1>Examinations</h1></a>
<p>There will be one midterm and one final examination. The midterm will be in-class during the scheduled
class time. The final examination will be in class during the allocated time in the Finals Week. All exams
will be closed-book with a cheat sheet that is hand-written on both sides of an letter/A4 paper.</p>
